                This interactive Data Device uses the live intersectional coordinates between a 3D model of a Accessible toilet and a digital replica of our data device, tracking the movement of the user in space, and their distance to objects.</p>

                <p><span class="title_content">DATA DEVICE (Physical)<br/></span>
                The data decivec is an interactive LED 'wand'. the user places their phone in the phone holder and grabs the end of the stick. by swinging the wand through the air, LED lights that cross a virtual bandary of the 3d model of the accessible toilet will switch on, while the rest stay off, indeed the user can trace the 3d planes of their model in space.</p>

                <p><span class="title_content">DATA DEVICE (Digital)<br/></span>
                The Digital Twin of the data device provides additional information. It displayes the 3D model that the user is interacting with, allows them to place it where they choose and displays a dashboard giving the user more precise information about the distance they are to virtual objects and 3d planes. allowing them to be able to measure their environment, and design more precisely .</p>

                <p><span class="title_content">HOW TO<br/></span>
                First. place you phone in the phone holder. open the app and point it at spacious floor plane where you want to place your 3D model and explore it. View in the phone screen your wand movement match that of the pov of user in the App. See the model in the AR and walk up to a plane, point the wand to the plane and intersect it with the stick, look at the 'real' stick' light up and start exploring the 3D model you are in in a physical way.</p>
